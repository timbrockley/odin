	* \code
	*   // excludeDeclsFromPCH = 1, displayDiagnostics=1
	*   Idx = clang_createIndex(1, 1);

	/**
	* Perform code completion at a given location in a translation unit.
	*
	* This function performs code completion at a particular file, line, and
	* column within source code, providing results that suggest potential
	* code snippets based on the context of the completion. The basic model
	* for code completion is that Clang will parse a complete source file,
	* performing syntax checking up to the location where code-completion has
	* been requested. At that point, a special code-completion token is passed
	* to the parser, which recognizes this token and determines, based on the
	* current location in the C/Objective-C/C++ grammar and the state of
	* semantic analysis, what completions to provide. These completions are
	* returned via a new \c CXCodeCompleteResults structure.
	*
	* Code completion itself is meant to be triggered by the client when the
	* user types punctuation characters or whitespace, at which point the
	* code-completion location will coincide with the cursor. For example, if \c p
	* is a pointer, code-completion might be triggered after the "-" and then
	* after the ">" in \c p->. When the code-completion location is after the ">",
	* the completion results will provide, e.g., the members of the struct that
	* "p" points to. The client is responsible for placing the cursor at the
	* beginning of the token currently being typed, then filtering the results
	* based on the contents of the token. For example, when code-completing for
	* the expression \c p->get, the client should provide the location just after
	* the ">" (e.g., pointing at the "g") to this code-completion hook. Then, the
	* client can filter the results based on the current token text ("get"), only
	* showing those results that start with "get". The intent of this interface
	* is to separate the relatively high-latency acquisition of code-completion
	* results from the filtering of results on a per-character basis, which must
	* have a lower latency.
	*
	* \param TU The translation unit in which code-completion should
	* occur. The source files for this translation unit need not be
	* completely up-to-date (and the contents of those source files may

	*
	* \param complete_column The column at which code-completion should occur.
	* Note that the column should point just after the syntactic construct that
	* initiated code completion, and not in the middle of a lexical token.
	*
	* \param unsaved_files the Files that have not yet been saved to disk
	* but may be required for parsing or code completion, including the
	* contents of those files.  The contents and name of these files (as
	* specified by CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the
